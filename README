FireDeck

FireDeck is a slidedeck for presentations about Firefox.
It is built in Microsoft Powerpoint and uses official FF logos and Creative Commons licensened images. Some free icons are used as well as some Foxkeh icons.
The official font for FF is Meta; these slides use two free variant fonts: meta-medium and meta-normal.

The original purpose of these slidedecks is to provide shareable presentation material on Firefox 4 and the new rapid release schedule of Firefox. The slidedeck template will be used to make presentations about FF 5, 6 & 7 as they are released and on an on-going basis.

The idea is to make this material shareable; this is licensed as CC BY-NON-REMIX, however any copyrighted/trademarked material is of course excluded from a CC license. 

Powerpoint is the tool I'm most used to - if others would like to convert the material to another format, such as Open Office or Keynote, that would be great. I'd love to include other formats here.

Thanks to all the amazing folks at Mozilla for Firefox.
